        the following is an example of my first work and personal pet project. the game takes place in the distant future in
        which planets are decimated for a simple resource, Seraph a mineral with no usefull application but rare driving its 
        value to such heights. You'll piliot a space ship from the various 6 companies and manage resources as you fight others
