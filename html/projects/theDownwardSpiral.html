        <p>
            The door chimes as it opens and closes with a loud thump. As I stumbled out the door the cold crisp air 
            reverberated in my lungs. The frigid winter atmosphere feels like pins pricking my lips as they become numb. My 
            breath is illuminated by the faint yellow light of the street lamps lighting up the sidewalks a golden hue with 
            their golden hue. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a particularly chilly night for being this early in november. The sidewalks were dusted 
            with a light powdering of snow which lightly crunched under the trudge of my feet. A couple blocks passed me by 
            as I walked home but the concoction of cheap whiskey and greasy pub food in my stomach couldn't hold. I painted 
            the snow bank in shades of green and brown with chewed up bits of red as I peppered it with chunks of old pizza.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know I shouldn't be here. I know I shouldn't be doing this. Another job just went down the drain and rent is 
            due next week. But the thought of staying home stuck in my head and rotting felt unbearable. It's nearly the end 
            of the year and I've already gone through four jobs. I don't even know how I made it this far. “I can't even get 
            unemployment,” I grumbled to myself under my breath. God i fucked up big here. Or maybe i was fucked from the 
            start. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I looked off into the distance and saw the lights of my apartment building illuminating the cracked
            sidewalks and potholes in the parking lot along with the marred walls with Cracks running up and down the paint 
            as the beige peeled. The paint indicating the parking spaces have long faded to the point of them barely being 
            recognizable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thud! wooh wooh wooh wooh! 
        </p>
        <p>
            My train of thought came to a sudden halt as I clumsily stumbled over a 
            massive hole in the parking lot falling into one of the cars slamming my body against the hood triggering a car 
            alarm. The sound of a door slamming shortly followed by the screaming of my irate neighbor Theressa. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “What the f*** are you doing,” she said her voice shrill but filled with demand as she stood right outside her door 
            wearing slippers and a bathrobe with her face twisted in a scowl. a marlboro cigarette dangled from her mouth 
            the cherry gently glows upon her face. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh i'm sorry to bother you,” sheepishly the words squirmed out of my mouth. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “Sorry my a$$ what the f*** you think youre doing at one am huh,” she hissed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “I'm sorry I.” 
        </p>
        <p>
            “yeah yeah and another thing you reek of booze why don't you get a goddamn job ya goddamn bum 
            I know you're selling drugs up there,” she dismissed barely leaving any time for a response. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “No mam i swear i don.” cut off in dismissal.
        </p>
        <p> 
            “Yeah yeah now get out of my sight i have to wake up early in the morning you're just lucky I don't tell the 
            landlord on you,” she snarled as she interrupted. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes mam,” I muttered. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes mam pfft get the f*** out,” she mackingly murmured. 
        </p>
        <p>
            swiftly but clumsily I made my way towards my apartment fumbling with the keys as I tried to 
            find the right one attempting not to disturb my neighbors further. I sloppily pressed the key into the lock and 
            twist. click. The instant the door closed my coat dropped to the floor with a thud and I breathed a heavy sigh 
            of relief. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally home might as well grab some grub before I pass out. I staggered to the fridge and flung the 
            doors open with complete disregard as my clumsy hands reached for the white styrofoam box containing leftover lo 
            mein and fried rice from The Chinese Dragon. Excitedly I pried open the box to reveal an atrocious odor offending 
            my nose and white fuzz speckled all over the slimy noodles. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Dammit, I guess I'll go without for now. I really need to clean out my fridge. I tossed it back in the fridge and 
            made my way to the living room. I'm sure I'll get to 
            it eventually. My body flung itself onto the couch almost as if on its own and I pulled my phone out of my jeans 
            pocket. Its cracked screen lights up. I forgot I had it on silent all night while I was out at Pazi’s Pub. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I instantly opened it to “her”. I forgot that I was looking at our conversation. Hoping I may have misread 
            something or that maybe the words changed or there was some sign of hope that things weren’t completely over. I 
            know it's over. No matter how many times I check. There's no denying that but it feels so strange that she's gone. 
            When you spend so much of your life living a certain way it's hard to believe in a way of life without them and 
            when it happens it's so surreal. Granted I know I deserve this and I've had it coming. Though I guess dwelling on 
            it wont change a thing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I reluctantly closed the chat to reveal that I've got a missed call and even a voicemail 
            from my mother reluctantly I opened the voicemail and the speaker crackled to life. “Beep Hey sweetie this is 
            your mom. Have you been eating alright? Me n your father are worried about you. You've had this janitor job for 
            what? 2 weeks! And before that quickie mart for a week and don't even get me started on wally world. Point being 
            we're worried about why dont you move back home. Barbarra’s son was saying there's an opening at the cranberry 
            marsh. I hear the.” I threw my phone onto the recliner. 
        </p>
        <p>
            F***… I needed that for music. I sluggishly pulled my body 
            in reach of my phone and awkwardly reached out my arm and grasped it. Click. It connected it to the bluetooth on 
            my stereo and I put on some music from my playlist and set my phone on my plate and cup-ridden trunk that served 
            as a coffee table plopped in the middle of the living room. I plopped my head on the arm rest of the couch and I 
            stared at the ceiling letting the lyrics engulf my senses and drown out my thoughts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I could never move back in with my mother. Having my own place is my last shred of dignity. Never again will 
            I be trapped. As I was thinking that the lights began to flicker and a scent of mold and mildew filled the air. 
            I quickly sprang up to investigate what was happening. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To my surprise there was a figure sitting in my recliner in a pinstripe vest, dapper black 
            pants and a deep maroon tie. Though what was strange was he had no face, just a bundle of mushrooms protruding out 
            the neck of his shirt. “Hello there, lovely place you've got. I admire the decor,” he says, gesturing at the 
            disaster that I called my living room with his sickly hands. His voice was soothing and lulling but you could 
            sense a clear intent hiding underneath. But the softness of his words can't help but dull your defenses. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “What is it you want,” I muttered, cautiously watching for his reaction. He gets up from his chair and begins 
            to pace around me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “What is it I want? Hmm, that is an interesting question. The question is what do you want? What you 
            truly want. I can feel the answer tugging at your soul clawing at it desperate to mature into reality.”
        </p>
        <p> 
            “What makes you so certain that you know? who are you even?” he pauses for a second and puts his hand to his stalks. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            “Who am I? You’re asking all of the interesting questions. Unimportant ,but interesting questions. Though I guess 
            I'll entertain a few of them to some degree. To a select few I am known as the King Of Rot and why I know. Well 
            lets just say I'm in the business of souls and in the business of granting a specific wish. A wish for a means 
            to an end,” he said with a subtle delight in his voice dragging his finger on the arm of the couch leaving a black 
            residue in its wake. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “A means to an end? What does that even mean,” I said with a tinge of uncertainty. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “In life there is a certain mundane pain that eats and rots aways at the soul, a certain corrosion of who you 
            are. You become husk of who you were and in their last desperation they reach out to me to ease their pain. 
            All who see me have felt this rot, even you. In your life you've tried and failed and just barely scraped by 
            just barely subsisting only for a single moment to wipe out all you've accomplished for everything you've had 
            everyone loved to disappear in a second leaving you with nothing but haunting memories. It's quite funny you 
            humans are like sisyphus running a boulder up a hill never knowing true satisfaction. You come up with comforting 
            words and lofty explanations to justify this but deep in your soul you know. there's only one answer and some 
            loathe it while others embrace it. I come to a special few who embrace it and help those who disdain it 
            come to embrace it. I'm sure you'll someday come to understand what I mean. But alas my time with you is coming 
            to an end but this chat has proven most entertaining I'm certain this won't be the last time you see me 
            hopefully you'll come to my embrace,” and with that he bowed and his body and clothes eroded away into a black dust 
            dispersing upon the carpet. 
        </p>

            What does he mean by all that I thought to myself as I went to the closest to grab the vacuum to clean up his 
            remains. 
            His words elude me often leaving me baffled but a terrifying thought looms over all of that. What if he's right. 
            I've spent my entire adulthood selling myself to job after job, each taking a piece of me. Piece of my life. 
            Piece of my dignity. Selling my time for something so soulless. Functioning like a moving corpse. Then when I 
            cease my functions from full efficiency I'm left decrepit looking down upon by all who surround me only to 
            continue this cycle of abuse. I'm barely getting by. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The only reason I'm able to eat is because of the food 
            stamps I'm on and there are more than enough people eager to take that away saying I don't deserve them. It 
            terrifies me to even consider that they might be right. Hell, I'm not even able to get unemployment due to my 
            last job firing me for “performance issues”. Maybe I'm destined to be a failure. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Does there exist a means to an 
            end? Is it possible to be happy? I laid my head down as these thoughts swirled through my head as I lulled to 
            sleep. Restless as I tossed and turned my dreams washed over me like a suffocating tide. Suddenly silence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I was walking through a forest in the dark. It was the middle of summer and the warm breeze brushed over my skin 
            as bugs buzzed about. As I walked my eyes stumbled upon the sight of a deer laying upon the ground, one of its 
            horns was broken off and lacerations all over its body as it layed in a pool of its own blood. Suddenly the air 
            became frigid as my breath danced about the air as little wisps. Mushrooms began growing out of the wounds. My 
            eyes darted to the distance and something didn't seem right. On the horizon were 3 figures slowly coming towards 
            me in the distance. I couldn't make out any details but somehow I knew that if they got to me some tragedy would 
            happen.
