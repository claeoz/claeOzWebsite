        <h1>The Myst That Rolls Over The River Town</h1>
        <H2>by Clae Oczachowski</H2>

        <p>
            I was originally born in a small town known for its river. It was where I was raised. Its waters flowed swiftly
            battering the shore and early mornings the myst would descend upon the town bathing it in its thick grey vapors
            locking it in this eerie charm. It was as if the town was preserved in a timeless ghostly glow.</p>
        <p>
            To add to the mystique the town never faced any of the severe storms all of the neighboring towns suffered. 
            Itd miss the town and go around as if afraid. Tornadoes, straight winds, hailstorms. They'd all miss our town. The indigenous knew 
            it as the land where the storms broke. 
        </p>
        <p>
            a lot of the boys of the town didn't live very long. Dying to suicide or behaviour that could only be described 
            as so reckless to border on suicidal. I was not immune to this influence and I could always feel the pull of 
            the town. A thin atmosphere filled with an underlying dread.
        </p>
        <p>
            The town always had an unusual feel to it. As if it was a desecrated holy land. Eventually I managed to move away from the town 
            that I've grown so used to. Though I couldn't escape it forever. It was everyone's dream to one day leave the 
            small dreary town and make a life for ourselves yet we were always pulled back. Sometimes through tragedy and 
            loss or sometimes for a strange longing. Regardless, I am here back the air twice as thick and filled with a 
            melancholy as I walk through a town once familiar with echoes of the past reverberating in my mind. As the mist 
            rolls in,  I wonder will I ever be able to leave?
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            I wondered about that for a long time. Though I'm hardly alone and like some I eventually did. Started work in a 
            couple towns over working at the local supermarket as a stocker.
        </p>
        <p>
            The town wasn't that big but in comparison to where I came from it felt like a metropolis. The past four years 
            working for the supermarket has been dreary. but I do what I must to keep a roof over my head. 
            A common story but I was overworked and underpaid but it paid the bills nothing more nothing less. Did what I must 
            and I made it out. 
            That's all that matters. At least out here I had a chance and a hope for the future. It may be a slight naivety
            but when it's all you've got you cling to dear life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And so the day started the same as any other day. Beep beep beep. Groggily I slapped the alarm in a sad excuse 
            of an attempt to silence the blaring alarm. 
            After multiple attempts the alarm gave in and gave me my morning advertisements. Sloppily I attempt to hit the 
            x only to bring up the ad itself in the browser. the usual scummy scam ads.
        </p>
        <p>
            Great, this is going to mess up my algorithm. This has become a regular morning occurrence. My body begrudgingly 
            arises out of bed as I begin to shuffle into my work uniform and start making my way to the door. 
            After that I was just another monotonous drone dissociation punching in and doing their work to the rhythm of the 
            employer, same as everyone else. The carefully calculated quota that dictates our life all the way down to the
            very use of our basic bodily functions for the next nine hours. As you work everything fades away. 
            the same six songs playing overhead ,the chatter of customers ,the beeps of the registers going off in a rhythm
            so blatant yet lulling that it shows up in your dreams. 
            It all might as well not exist as your mind fades away and retreats in on itself.
